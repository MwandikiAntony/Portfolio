      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a results-driven <span className="font-semibold">Full Stack Web Developer</span> 
        with a strong foundation in <span className="font-semibold">Applied Physics</span> and 
        <span className="font-semibold"> Computer Science</span>. I specialize in building 
        modern, secure, and scalable web applications using technologies such as 
        <span className="font-semibold"> React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB,</span> and 
        <span className="font-semibold"> TypeScript</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        My experience spans across developing and deploying production-ready applications, 
        including notable projects like the <span className="font-semibold">Capital Bank of Kenya App</span> 
        — a digital banking platform streamlining financial operations — and the 
        <span className="font-semibold"> Afya Diary Kenya App</span>, a healthcare platform 
        enhancing patient–doctor engagement and digital health record management.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve collaborated with startups, enterprise teams, and individual clients to deliver 
        end-to-end solutions — from UX/UI design and backend architecture to cloud deployment 
        and maintenance. I’m particularly passionate about crafting intuitive user experiences 
        and writing clean, maintainable code.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond development, I’m deeply interested in the intersection of technology and science, 
        leveraging analytical thinking from my physics background to solve complex engineering 
        problems. I continuously learn new tools and frameworks to stay ahead in the ever-evolving 
        web ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I’m not coding, I enjoy mentoring other developers, exploring product design, 
        and contributing to open-source projects that make a positive impact.
