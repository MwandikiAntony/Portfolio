      <p>
        I’m a full stack web developer with a passion for building responsive,
        user-friendly, and scalable web applications. I specialize in React,
        Next.js, Node.js, and TypeScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve worked with startups, freelance clients, and open-source projects,
        building everything from MVPs to full-stack platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy learning new tools, sharing knowledge, and
        exploring product design.
